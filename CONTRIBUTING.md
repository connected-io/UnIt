## View or Add Work to Backlog

_UnIt_'s backlog can be found under the issues tab.  Before submitting a new issue, consider,
- if what you are proposing fits the [vision](#vision) of _UnIt_.
- checking to see if an existing issue already exists.

Think about the searchability of issues

That said, we leave it to your best judgement

### Requesting Features or Enhancements

Use the [feature template](https://github.com/connected-io/UnIt/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) when filing an issue.

- Consider if what you are requesting may in fact be a bug, especially if it deals with existing features.

### Reporting Bugs

Use the [bug template](https://github.com/connected-io/UnIt/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) when filing an issue.

- Do your very best to fill out all the fields, you never know when that little bit of extra information might be the key to solving a problem!
- When filling out the **description & impact**, remember to think of user impact and how it may relate to broadly to consumers.  Your request may better fall under the _'maintenance'_ or _'other questions'_ category if you find yourself unable to verbalize this impact.

### Logging Maintenance Work

Use the [chore template](https://github.com/connected-io/UnIt/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/chore_log.md) when filing an issue.

- Think about taking a quick look at the [feature-requests](#requesting-features-or-enhancements) or [bug-reports](#reporting-bugs).  If your suggestion has any **user-facing** value or impact, it may be better to go those other routes.

### Other Questions or Requests

Use the [questions template](https://github.com/connected-io/UnIt/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/questions.md) when filing an issue.

- Take a look at [UnIt FAQ's](https://github.com/connected-io/UnIt/blob/master/FAQs.md) to see if someone might've already asked the same question.
- After having your question answered, consider contributing to the [UnIt FAQ's](https://github.com/connected-io/UnIt/blob/master/FAQs.md) for the benefit of future explorers.
